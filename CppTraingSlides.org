* Introduction
C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural,
object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.
* Hello World
#+BEGIN_SRC C++ 
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
     std::cout << "Hello, world. " << std::endl;
     return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Hello | world. |

* History
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey,
as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed 
C++ in 1983.
* Setup
  For windows we can download latest precompiled binaries for gcc tool chain at tdm-gcc.trdragon.org
  


* Build Tools
  gnu toolchain provide g++ command to build executable from source code.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
g++ Program.cpp
#+END_SRC
* Popular Tools

* Build Process
** Compiling
** Linking

Converting C++ source code in machine language which can be exectured by underline microprocessor
is called as build process.
* Language Features
1. Statically typed
2. Support procedural , object oriented and generic programming paradigms
3. Compiled
4. Versatile standard library
5. Encapsulation
6. Inheritance
7. Polymorphism 


* Variables and Fundamental Data Types
| Category  | Type                      | Meaning       | Example |   |
|-----------+---------------------------+---------------+---------+---|
| boolean   | bool                      | true or false |         |   |
| Character | char                      |               |         |   |
| Integer   | short,int,long,long long  |               |         |   |
| floating  | float, double,long double |               |         |   |
| void      | no type                   |               |         |   |
