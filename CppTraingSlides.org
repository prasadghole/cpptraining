* Introduction
C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural,
object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.

#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
     std::cout << "Hello, world. To C++ " << std::endl;
     return 0;
}
#+END_SRC
